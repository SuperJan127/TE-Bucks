# ðŸ’¸ TE Bucks (Backend API)

**TE Bucks** is a RESTful backend application for a peer-to-peer money transfer system. It was developed as part of the Tech Elevator Java Web Development bootcamp to simulate real-world API development.

The backend was built to support a provided front-end application (not included in this repository), and includes features like user login, balance management, and secure money transfers between accounts.

## Features

- Secure user authentication with token-based login
- REST API for viewing balances, sending/requesting funds, and transaction history
- Transfer approval and status tracking
- Basic overdraft protection logic
- DAO tests for all database operations

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Spring Boot
- JDBC
- PostgreSQL
- RESTful API design
- JUnit (for DAO testing)

## Notes

This project emphasized backend development and data integrity. I focused on building out the core business logic, creating RESTful endpoints, and testing data access layers to ensure accuracy and performance. While the frontend was provided by Tech Elevator for testing, it is not included in this repo.
